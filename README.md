# Linear Regression using Python-
In this project I will be finding student's total marks based on number of hours he studied using the linear regression model.
So first I will import all the libraries that are required for this project. Then I will import the data I want to perform analysis on. 
I will read the data using pandas library. Then I will draw a matplot using matplot library to find if there exists a relationship between the 2 variables.
Finding relationship is necessary because only then I can use the linear regression model for prediction.
After finding the relationship, I will divide the data into labels and attributes using string indexing.
Then I will use train,test and split model from scikit learn library to split my dataset in 2 parts, one for training and other for testing.
I will import LinerRegression model from scikit learn library to train my model.
Once the model is trained, I will test it.
