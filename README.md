# Linear Regression using Python.
In this project, I will be finding a student's total marks based on the number of hours he studied using the linear regression model.
So first I will import all the libraries that are required for this project. Then I will import the data I want to perform analysis on. 
I will read the data using the panda's library. Then I will draw a matplot diagram using the matplot library to find if there exists a relationship between the 2 variables.
Finding a relationship is necessary because only then I can use the linear regression model for prediction.
After finding the relationship, I will divide the data into labels and attributes using string indexing.
Then I will use the train, test, and split model from the scikit-learn library to split my dataset into 2 parts, one for training and the other for testing.
I will import the linear regression model from the scikit-learn library to train my model.
Once the model is trained, I will test it.
